He does provide links to original videos in the description though. But he doesnt include his own comentary or anything extra , just top 10 countdown and copy pasted videos.

Soooo After spending at least the last two/three years suffering from horrendous depression, struggling with anxiety and doubting my self worth or point of existence, I managed to start crawling out of my hole this past year.

I decided to make a list of the best players/mains I've seen so far for every character (I've watched almost every Major/Regional/Monthly/Weekly since the game came out). amp#x200B; I figured this could be useful for someone looking to learn from videos of their main character, so they can learn from the best!

This was upsetting for a few days, but then crispypretzel pointed out that I could devote my life entirely to getting juicy and auto auctions. And so begins this meet prep."

For some context, streamers were able to play Borderlands 3 for about 90 minutes after the gameplay reveal presentation.

I was going to spend some time writing a post about emo rock and its influence on modern pop music (which will still happen at some point), but before doing so I recently noticed that UKF Music was celebrating their 10th anniversary this month. They posted about it earlier this year (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiuzc7madRM), but UKF created their dubstep YouTube channel on April 29th.
